Welcome to FOG!
This modpack was made by two autistic monkeys, who got bored speedrunning overpowered modpacks and wanted to make a more challenging, but not overstacked modpack. We wanted to make sure that low-end PCs could run the modpack, because... Because morality I guess? I dunno. But while keeping the mod count under control, we wanted to make sure its a challenging, (rather fun) creation. So have fun and don't forget: if you're jumping out of a plane, you can say, I can fly until the end of my life.
